\subsection{Scheme Description}
Sparse matrices are extensively used in scientific computing, however there is no automatic differentiation package in Julia yet to handle sparse matrix operations. This project utilizes the reversible embedded domain-specific language NiLang.jl to differentiate sparse matrix operations by writing the sparse matrix operations in a reversible style. The generated backward rules are ported to ChainRules.jl as an extension, so that one can access these features in an automatic differentiation package like Zygote, Flux and Diffractor directly.
\subsection{Time Planning}

This project is shipped by four (mostly) sequential stages:
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
    \item Implement low level operations by NiLang.
    \item Carefully test by CI and export chain rules into ChainRules.jl. 
    \item Implement high level operations by NiLang and export chain rules.
    \item Add some use cases and enhance docs. 
\end{enumerate}

I list the timeline of this project in the form of Gantt chart.
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
    \item 1st Jul - 31st Jul \quad Implement low level operations by NiLang. 
    \item 1st Aug - 15th Aug   \quad Carefully test by CI and export chain rules into ChainRules.jl.
    \item 15th Sep - 20th Sep \quad  Implement high level operations by NiLang and export chain rules. 
    \item 21st Sep - 30th Sep \quad Add some use cases and enhance docs.
\end{enumerate}
