\section{Summary of the Proposal}

Sparse matrices are extensively used in scientific computing, however there is no automatic differentiation package in Julia yet to handle sparse matrix operations yet. This project will utilize the reversible embedded domain-specific language NiLang.jl to differentiate sparse matrix operations by re-writing the sparse functions in Julia base in a reversible style. We will port the generated backward rules to ChainRules.jl as an extension, where ChainRules.jl is the most popular Julia package providing backward rules for automatic differentiation packages.
